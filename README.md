# Stuck in Pimbo

Pims are stuck in pimbo-limbo and floating around. Help them out by directing them to get a body by collecting a skull. Then finalise the fusion with the help of magic by collecting orbs. Once back and fully aware, they'll rejoice and head towards the light... earth?

This is an HTML5 game developed by bootstrut and tropvache (@doopa_kapusta && @tropvache) for the Ludum Dare Challenge. Everything was made by us: graphics, code, music, and the concept.
